# Server Issue Resolution

## âœ… **Issue Fixed: Windows mDNS Compatibility**

### Problem
The original server was trying to use mDNS (multicast DNS) for network discovery, but the `multicast_dns` package had compatibility issues on Windows with the `reusePort` socket option.

**Error:**
```
Dart Socket ERROR: ../../runtime/bin/socket_win.cc:185: `reusePort` not supported for Windows.
Failed to start mDNS advertising: OS Error: An unknown, invalid, or unsupported option or level was specified in a getsockopt or setsockopt call., errno = 10042
```

### Solution Applied
1. **Platform-specific discovery**: Skip mDNS entirely on Windows and use UDP broadcast directly
2. **Better error handling**: Added graceful fallback and clearer user messaging
3. **Port conflict handling**: Added specific error handling for port-in-use scenarios

### Code Changes Made

#### network_discovery.dart
- âœ… **Windows Detection**: Skip mDNS on Windows platform
- âœ… **UDP Broadcast Only**: Use more reliable UDP broadcast for Windows
- âœ… **Better Logging**: Clearer messages about what discovery method is being used
- âœ… **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of broadcast failures

#### main.dart  
- âœ… **Port Conflict Handling**: Specific error message for port 10048 (address in use)
- âœ… **User Guidance**: Clear instructions on how to resolve port conflicts
- âœ… **Graceful Exit**: Proper exit codes for different error scenarios

## ðŸš€ **Current Status: WORKING**

The server now starts successfully on Windows with:
```
Starting Remote Mouse Server...
Server available at: 192.168.1.2:8080
Using UDP broadcast for server discovery (Windows)
UDP broadcast started - advertising 192.168.1.2:8080 every 5 seconds
Mobile devices can now discover this server automatically
Server running on ws://0.0.0.0:8080
Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

## ðŸ“± **Next Steps**
1. **Test Mobile Client**: Run the Flutter app to test auto-discovery
2. **Test Manual Connection**: Verify fallback manual IP entry works
3. **Test Mouse Control**: Verify actual mouse movement and clicking

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Notes**
- **Discovery Method**: UDP broadcast every 5 seconds on port 41234
- **Server Protocol**: WebSocket on configurable port (default 8080)
- **Platform Support**: Windows (primary), with mDNS fallback for other platforms
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallbacks at every level

The mDNS compatibility issue has been resolved by implementing a Windows-specific path that bypasses the problematic mDNS functionality in favor of the more reliable UDP broadcast method.
